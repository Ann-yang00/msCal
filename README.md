msCal is a JUCE plugin that calculates the millisecond duration for pre-delay, decay time, and total time based on a given BPM and effect size.

### :abacus: Calculation

For a given BPM, the millisecond duration of a quarter note is calculated as:

`60,000 ms รท BPM = duration of a quarter note`

The pre-delay is set to 1/64 of the quarter note duration:

`Pre-delay = (quarter note duration) รท 64`

The remaining is the decay time, calculated as:

`Decay time = Total time - Pre-delay`


### :warning: Known Issues
